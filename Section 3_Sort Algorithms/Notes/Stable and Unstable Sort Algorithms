When sorting an array where we have more than on of the same value then it matters where they end up after they are sorted
If the duplicate values end up swapping sides, this can be consequential

Unstable Algorithm - Algorithms where duplicate values may swap sides

Stable Algorithm - The opposite. Bubble sort makes sure that this does not happen since it only swaps values that are either higher or lower than array[i]
