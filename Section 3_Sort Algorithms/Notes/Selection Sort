SELECTION SORT

- Works similarly to Bubble sort
- Each traversal we are selection the highest value and moving it to the sorted partition
- O(n^2) QUADRATIC TIME COMPLEXITY: It will take 100 steps to sort 10 items, it will take 1 000 000 steps to sort 1000 items - Degrades quickly
- Does not require as much swapping as bubble sort - average case it performs better than bubble sort
- Unstable algorithm
