RECURSION

- Methods that call them self
- Breaks the problem down to smaller pieces
- Must have a condition that leads to the method no longer making another method call on itself - BASE CASE
- FACTORIALS: 5! ==  5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 == 5 * 4!
- Pros and Cons:
    -  Typically no calculations are done until the base case is reached. So for very large problems I may
       run out of memory since I'll have millions of open function calls. In those cases iteration works better
    - In many languages iterative solutions are way faster
    - In some cases, extremely fast and easy to code. Practical for tree traversals and binary search

     public static int recursiveFactorial(int num) {

            if (num == 0) {
                return 1;
            }

            return num * recursiveFactorial(num -1 );

      }
