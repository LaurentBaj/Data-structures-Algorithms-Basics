Comparing algorithms:
    - Since hardware is a massive factor in determining the speed of an algorithm, we can't simply measure the time it takes for the algorithm to be executed
    - We have to look at the number of steps that it takes to execute an algorithm - TIME COMPLEXITY
    - Complexity:
        - Time: the number of steps involved
        - Memory: amount of storage required (these days it is not a big issue)
    - When comparing algorithms we look at each's worst case
        - Looking at best cases is not helpful since they rarely happen
