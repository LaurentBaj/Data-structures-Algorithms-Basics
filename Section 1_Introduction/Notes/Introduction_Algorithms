ALGORITHMS

- Algorithm - Finite number of instructions that is intended to solve a problem
- Algorithm != Implementation: Algorithm explains the steps that have to be performed, an implementation is the code you write to perform those steps
    - There can be many different implementation of the same algorithm
        - If the first step to make a tea is to boil the water, then the implementation can be to boil it using a: sauce pan, kettle on a stove or over a camp fire
